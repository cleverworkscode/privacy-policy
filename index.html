    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>Formula Run ("the App") is developed by Cleverworks Code. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Formula Run, we collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information</strong> — When you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple ID identifier and, if you choose to share it, your name. We store a display name you provide during profile setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Running data</strong> — Times you submit for race events within your league, including timestamps and any applicable penalties.</li>
        <li><strong>League data</strong> — League names, team names, and membership information necessary to operate your private league.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used solely to provide the App's functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticating your identity</li>
        <li>Displaying your profile and running times to members of your league</li>
        <li>Computing standings and rankings within your league</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any purpose beyond the App's core features.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication), hosted on Google Cloud infrastructure. Data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your personal information to third parties. Your running times and profile are only visible to other members of leagues you join.</p>

    <h2>Tracking</h2>
    <p>Formula Run does not track you across other apps or websites. We do not use advertising identifiers or third-party analytics services.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as your account exists. You can delete your account at any time from the Profile screen within the App. When you delete your account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your user profile is permanently deleted</li>
        <li>Your submitted times and league memberships are removed</li>
        <li>If you are a league administrator, the league and all its data are also deleted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Formula Run is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>
